# Weekli: a preference saving schedule maker for repeating weekly schedules

This program allows multiple users to enter in preferences for working a given time block, and after entering shift times can generate schedules that best fit the users' preferences

## To start:

run 'npm start'

## To use:

Simply add users and use the schedule interface to set preferences for specific periods of time. Preferences include 'Cannot work', 'Prefer not to work', 'No preference', 'Prefer to work', and 'Must work'. Time can be selected by clicking individual 15-minute blocks, or by toggling the 'paint' button, which allows a user to quickly set preferences for stretches of time. Paint preferences by clicking once to begin painting, moving the mouse over blocks to fill them in, then clicking again to stop painting.

Enter shifts by clicking 'Add Shifts' and defining blocks of time in the same manner as setting preferences.
